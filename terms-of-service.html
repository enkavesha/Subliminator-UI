                                            <p>We hope this never happens, but in the instance Subliminator should get sued because of something that you did, you agree to defend and indemnify us. That means you’ll defend Subliminator (including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, or your account’s infringement of someone else’s rights.</p>
                                            <p>We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.</p>

We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for extended periods of time. The User is responsible for providing Subliminator with accurate information (including but not limited to its retail price). If the User has provided Subliminator with inaccurate or false information, (a) the User shall be liable to Subliminator for damages and losses (including but not limited to taxes) arising out of such inaccurate or false information and (b) the User shall reimburse such damages and losses (including but not limited to taxes) to Subliminator, and (c) Subliminator shall have the right to charge the Client for such damages and losses (including but not limited to taxes).</p>

                                    <p>Subliminator may save Member's credit or debit card information and use it for all future shipments and charges, which will automatically be charged to the saved card, unless the Member notifies Subliminator through the Site. When you order a Product, or use a Service that has a fee, you will be charged then current fees, which we may change from time to time (such when we have holiday sales or offer you discount of base product price). We may choose to temporarily change the fees for our Services for promotional events or new Services, and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event or new Service on the Site. The sale will be submitted for processing and you will be charged as soon as you click on the "confirm" button. You will then receive an email from us.</p>
                                    <p>By placing an order through the Site, you are confirming that you are legally entitled to use the means of payment tendered and, in the case of card payments, that you are either the cardholder or have the cardholder's express permission to utilise the card to effect payment.</p>
                                    <p>In case of an unfounded chargeback, the User shall reimburse Subliminator for its losses, which consist of fulfillment costs and chargeback handling fees ($15 USD per chargeback).</p>
                                    <p>We may refuse to process a transaction for any reason or refuse Service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of refusing or suspending any transaction after processing has begun.</p>
                                    <p>Unless otherwise stated, all fees and payments are quoted in U.S. Dollars. The User is responsible for paying all fees, payments and applicable taxes associated with our Site and Services. After receiving your order you will receive an email from us confirming the details, description and price for the Products ordered together with some information on your rights to return your goods. Payment of the total price plus taxes and delivery must be made in full before dispatch of your Products.</p>
                                    <p>Discounts apply to eligible monthly recurring charges before taxes, shipping and other fees. Discounts are awarded only to Users over certain threshold of monthly revenue in the preceding calendar month. These tiers are listed on our Site and are subject to change.

                                    <p>Once you have clicked on the "confirm" button, it might be not possible to edit or cancel your order. If you want to change some parameters, Customer addresses, etc., please check whether such an option is available in your account. We are not bound to make such modifications in your order, but we will do our best on a case-by-case basis. Replacement of Products and credits to the Member's account for Products claimed as damaged or not received are subject to Subliminator investigation and discretion.</p>
                                    <p>The risk of loss and title for such items pass to the User upon our delivery to the carrier. It is the Customer's responsibility to file any claim with a carrier for a lost shipment if carrier tracking indicates that the Product was delivered. In such case Subliminator will not make any refunds and will not resend the Product.</p>
                                    <p>Subliminator will review replacement/return requests only (a) if there will be missing or broken Product, or a print error if it is Subliminator fault and (b) if Subliminator will receive a complaint within 30 days from the day the Product was delivered to the Customer (or within 30 days after the estimated delivery date, if the Product is missing).</p>

                                    <p>Whilst many component parts of our Products are standard, all Products available for purchase are described on their specific design page on our Site. We always try to represent each design as accurately as possible via photography and copy points provided by designers, artists or photographers.</p>
                                    <p>We have a policy of continuous Product development so we can provide you with what we consider the best design combined with best performance, and thus reserve the right to amend the specifications of Products, their price, packaging and any Service associated at any time, without prior notice. Before ordering, we thus invite you to have a close look at the Product description and design.</p>
                                    <p>We use our best efforts to provide you with the best images and descriptions, but unfortunately cannot guarantee that colours and details in website images are 100% accurate representations of the product, and sizes might in some cases be approximate.</p>
                                    <p>Sometimes during the manufacturing process Products can be damaged, obviously they won't be shipped out to Users and Customers, however they can still be used for charitable purposes. Subliminator reserves the right to donate all damaged items with full or partial designs to charity and the User hereby waives its right to collect royalties or other fees regarding damaged products that are donated.</p>

                                    <p>Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a Product which is accepted by us once we have sent you an email order confirmation. Any Products on the same order which we have not confirmed in a order confirmation e-mail do not form part of that contract.</p>
                                    <p>Subliminator shall under no circumstances be held liable for any special losses due to specific circumstances of the User an/or Customer, indirect or consequential losses or wasted expenditure.</p>
                                    <p>Orders are placed and received exclusively via the Site. Before ordering from us, it is the Member's responsibility to check and determine full ability to receive the Products. Correct Customer’s address and post code/zip code, User’s up-to-date telephone number and e-mail address are absolutely necessary to ensure successful delivery of Products.</p>
                                    <p>All information asked on the checkout page must be filled in precisely and accurately. Subliminator will not be responsible for missed delivery because of a wrong delivery address or an inappropriate phone number. Should you like to ask for a change in the delivery address, notify change in a phone number or any other special requirements, please contact Subliminator.</p>

                                    <p>Some sort of Products are packaged and shipped separately.
